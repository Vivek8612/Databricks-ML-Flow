This lesson examines managing the complexity of multistep machine learning projects using multistep workflows.\n\n## ![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) In this lesson you:<br>\n - Introduce multistep workflows\n - Execute a single, parameterized notebook as a step in a pipeline\n - Execute a multistep workflow"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"c0cc5944-146f-4ba8-ab21-6fd4040e8dc6"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["-sandbox\n### Managing the Complexity\n\nTools like Scikit-Learn and Spark ML use the abstraction of pipelines that bundle multiple stages together into a single object.  This works well as a first step in handling more complexity in the machine learning training process but has limitations in that these pipelines don't scale to support arbitrary code.  Rather, they normally only work with built-in functions in those packages.  Additionally, they do not allow for monitoring of each individual stage in that process.\n\nMLflow allows for more robust pipelining by using multistep workflows.  This not only allows for a more flexible API but it allows teams to collaborate at higher level since different contributors can be responsible for different aspects of the pipeline.\n\n**Multistep pipelines scales MLflow projects by allowing each stage to be its own project.**  The underlying idea that makes this possible is that **runs can recursively call other runs.**  This means that steps in a machine learning pipeline can be isolated.\n\nThere are a few options for passing artifacts between runs.  They can be saved to a common location or they can be logged as an artifact within MLflow.  This also allows for quicker iteration since runs can be run individually, you only need to rerun a given step if the last step's results have been cached.\n\nBelow is an example of a multistep workflow with four distinct steps.  <a href=\"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/multistep_workflow\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the full repository here.</a>\n\n<div><img src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/images/eLearning/ML-Part-4/mlproject-architecture0.png\" style=\"height: 250px; margin: 20px\"/></div>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"2e72fbd4-60d8-4211-818f-76f21d33bd52"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["-sandbox\n### Multistep Architecture\n\nNow that we can package projects and run them in their environment, let's look at how  we can make workflows consisting of multiple steps.
